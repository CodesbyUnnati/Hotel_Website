        <p>The staff were very approachable and helpful. The breakfast was good. They arranged for a taxi to pick us up
          from the airport and then back again at the end of our stay. The suite was very good with comfortable
          furniture and the bed was comfortable too. We would definitely stay here again. </p>

        <p>It was a good stay! The food was excellent and the staff superb! There was a staff member who was
          particularly helpful, accommodating and shared his knowledge about with us. Unfortunately I did not get
          his name but it appeared he assisted the front desk and also carried our luggage to our room.</p>
